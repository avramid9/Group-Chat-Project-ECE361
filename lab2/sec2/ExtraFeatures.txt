------------------Private Messaging------------------
The input for private messaging is of the form:

/pm <clientid> <text>

where <clientid> is the clientid of the person you want to send the private message to and <text> is the message you want to send.

This was implemented by creating two new message types, private message and private message nack.
Private message has type PM and contains the recipiant id and the text message, seperated by a space, in the data field.
Private message nack has type PM_NAK which contains the error message in the data field depending on what type of error has occured.

Type        Packet Data
PM          <recipiantID, message data>
PM_NAK      <reason for failiure>


The client will send a message of type PM when a user tries to send a private message. If no error occurs on the server,
the server will send a mesage of type MESSAGE to the intended client. If there is an error, then the server will send a message
of type PM_NAK back to the client who sent the private message with an error message for the client to print to the user.


------------------User Registration------------------
The input for creating new user if os the form:

/create <clientid> <password> <server-ip> <server port>

This function can only be called before logging in. If user is already logged in, this function will prompt them to log out first. This was implemented by creating a NEW packet that contains the new username and password that you want to create. Once successful, it will say account created, in which the user can then attempt to login with their new account. Server then sends back type NEW_ACK if username and passwords are valid, or NEW_NAK if the username is already taken.

Type         Packet Data
NEW          <password>
NEW_ACK      <none>
NEW_NAK      <reason for failure>
