------------------Private Messaging------------------
The input for private messaging is of the form:

/pm <clientid> <text>

where <clientid> is the cientid of the person you want to send the private message to and <text> is the message you want to send.

This was implemented by creating two new message types, private message and private message nack.
Private message has type PM and contains the recipiant id and the text message, seperated by a space, in the data field.
Private message nack has type PM_NAK which contains the error message in the data field depending on what type of error has occured.

Type        Packet Data
PM          <recipiantID, message data>
PM_NAK      <reason for failiure>


The client will send a message of type PM when a user tries to send a private message. If no error occurs on the server,
the server will send a mesage of type MESSAGE to the intended client. If there is an error, then the server will send a message
of type PM_NAK back to the client who sent the private message with an error message for the client to print to the user.
